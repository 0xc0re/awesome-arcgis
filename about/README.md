## Context

In this page I will try to explain to you why we started this project and the objective that it pursues.

Sometimes we hear **that people new to ArcGIS** find difficult to understand the technology because there are too much information about Esri and ArcGIS, but also because it is [spread in many  websites](../esri/README.md#websites).

Some people also told us the documentation is tough to read because sometimes it assumes you already have some background on GIS and/or ArcGIS (and that's not always true).

But even if you are already familiar with ArcGIS you might also suffer sometimes trying to find some documentation, resources, ... related to a product or technology, and that's because in Esri we have **more than 150 different sites on different subdomains** (with a few [thousands of pages](https://www.google.es/search?q=site%3Aesri.com+OR+site%3Aarcgis.com)).

Not even the search engines available<sup>[1](#search-engines)</sup>
. can offer a fulfilling solution to this problem, because not everything is ready to be indexed (for example some: community content or international distributor resources), and even if they could, they probably would not be able to properly structure and curate their results.

## About the project

That's why we decided to build this project, a collection of *[awesome lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/awesome.md)* for ArcGIS developers, a place where anyone could find **one page per technology or topic** with the best official but also the best community resources we know, included the localized ones.

> **Example awesome pages**: [Web AppBuilder Developer Edition](../arcgis/products/web-appbuilder/developer-edition/), [Configurable Apps](../arcgis/products/configurable-apps/), [Web Map Spec](../esri/open-vision/open-specifications/web-map/), [Esri-Leaflet](../front-end/technologies/leaflet/), [ArcGIS Pro and it's SDK](../arcgis/products/arcgis-desktop/arcgis-pro/), [Runtime SDK for Android](../mobile/technologies/android/), [REST APIs](../esri/open-vision/open-specifications/arcgis-rest-api/), etc,

We are working closely with many [ArcGIS experts](https://esri-es.github.io/arcgis-experts/) to collect the best information available for each topic, but of course we would love you could   [contribute](https://github.com/hhkaos/awesome-arcgis/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Our goals are to make it easier for anyone:
* To get started developing with ArcGIS
* To have a better picture of the state of the art on any topic (with all its available resources)
* To stay updated
* To extend his knowledge about the ArcGIS platform and it possibilities.

We really hope this project helps you to become an [ArcGIS experts](https://esri-es.github.io/arcgis-experts/) in the ArcGIS Platform.

Sincerely,<br>
[The contributors](graphs/contributors)
