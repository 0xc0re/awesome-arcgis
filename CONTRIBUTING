# Contributions

Please feel free to contribute to this list. The technology change fast and
some resources may be out to date.

You can use the "[resource page template](RESOURCE_PAGE_TEMPLATE.md)" to start a new resource page or to get ideas on which resources could be included.

A sample resources list that shows what we are trying to collect on each page is the
[Web AppBuilder resource page](arcgis/products/web-appbuilder/README.md).

Ways to contribute:
* If you find a broken link feel free to [open an issue](issue) or add a comment on Disqus
* If you find some missing information do the same thing
* You can help us just adding resources directly editing from your browser ([learn how](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/)).
* If you are a developer you can also fork this repo and do a pull request.
