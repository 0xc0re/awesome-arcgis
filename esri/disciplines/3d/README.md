## Introduction

ArcGIS allows you to generate your own 3D models from cadastral track, OSM, lidar, laser, CAD, BIM or even images taken with drones, edit them, symbolize them, perform analysis and share them as a 3D service (in ArcGIS Enterprise or ArcGIS Online), or as a compressed scene layer package, which can be viewed in ArcGIS Pro or ArcGIS Earth. In the web part remember that we have the scene viewer, templates, Web AppBuilder 3D, and the new JavaScript API 4.3. Using the Javascript API we can create 3D apps with feature service, 3D spatial analysis, dynamic dashboards, filters and ranges, etc.

Some examples:

* [Campus 3D Viewer](http://3dcampus.arcgis.com/EsriCampusViewer2017/)
* [3D Public Survey](http://tryitlive.arcgis.com/3DPublicSurvey/)

### Videos

We have created a [3D on the ArcGIS Platform Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLahIW2YFPQd4s3rJUwILIM8aAGENsyN9M) that we think it might be worth to you to save ([how to save a Youtube Playlist](../../../assets/SavePlaylist.gif)).
