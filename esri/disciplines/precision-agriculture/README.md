# Precision agriculture

**Precision agriculture** (**PA**), **satellite farming** or **site specific crop management** (**SSCM**) is a farming management concept based on observing, measuring and responding to inter and intra-field variability in crops. The goal of precision agriculture research is to define a decision support system (DSS) for whole farm management with the goal of optimizing returns on inputs while preserving resources. | *Source:  [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_agriculture)*.
