## Introduction

At Esri different teams ([Esri R&D DC Center](../../../esri/r-and-d/README.md), [Esri Spain Tech and Innovation team](https://github.com/esri-es/gis-talk-bot), ...) have been prototyping different chatbots, here you will find some resources to help you understand those projects.

## Community

If you are looking for help on Chatbots in general you might ask on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), but if you are build an ArcGIS Chatbot you should probably ask your questions on the [REST API group on GeoNet](https://community.esri.com/community/developers/web-developers/arcgis-rest-api) and mention one of the experts on GeoNet.

### People you should know

Please find the [ArcGIS Experts on this topic using this tool](https://esri-es.github.io/arcgis-experts/?topic=BIM):

[![ArcGIS Experts Tool Screenshot](https://github.com/esri-es/arcgis-experts/blob/master/assets/imgs/arcgis-experts-tool.png?raw=true)](https://esri-es.github.io/arcgis-experts/?topic=Bots)

They don't work on the support team and some may even not work at Esri,
but they are opening some projects and sharing insights related to this
technology so we recommend you to follow them.
