## Introduction

The [Esri Partner Network](https://www.esri.com/en-us/about/esri-partner-network/overview) is a rich ecosystem of organizations that work together to amplify The Science of Where. GIS Partners build on, extend, and help implement the ArcGIS platform. Global Alliances are industry leaders aligned with Esriâ€™s high level goals, joining forces to advance shared initiatives. Startups are new businesses on their way to becoming full partners.
