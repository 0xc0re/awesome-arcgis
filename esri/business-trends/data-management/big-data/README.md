# Big data

Big data is data sets that are so voluminous and complex that traditional data-processing application software are inadequate to deal with them. Big data challenges include capturing data, data storage, data analysis, search, sharing, transfer, visualization, querying, updating, information privacy and data source. | *Source:  [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data)*.

# Introduction

Big data use to be related IoT in the platform, but that's not always the case, that's why we have created a separated page for [ArcGIS and IoT](../iot/README.md)

There are a set of products in the ArcGIS platform you might want to know if you are interested in this topic:

* [GeoEvent](../../../arcgis/products/arcgis-enterprise/arcgis-server/geoevent-server/README.md)
* [GeoAnalytics](../../../arcgis/products/arcgis-enterprise/arcgis-server/geoanalytics-server/README.md)
* [Spatiotemporal Big Data Store](../../../arcgis/products/arcgis-enterprise/data-store/spatiotemporal-big-data-store/README.md)
