## Introduction

Esri Technical Support is specially designed to help you solve errors that arise in the use of ArcGIS Platform products. So they will assist you in order to provide you instructions, fixes, or report bugs to product teams if that't the case.

> **Note**: Esri Technical Support doesn't include support to the community projects published on Github or development issues **related to the code** of your applications or customizations. For this matter we aim you to use the [community initiatives](../community/README.md).

Communication channels and resource pages you must know:

* [Esri Support Website](https://support.esri.com)
* [Esri Technical Support Blog @ GeoNet](https://community.esri.com/groups/technical-support/blog/tags#/)
