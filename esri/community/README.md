## Introduction

What is a community?

> A common definition of community emerged as a group of people with diverse characteristics who are linked by social ties, share common perspectives, and engage in joint action in geographical locations or settings. - *Source: [ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)*

So there are many [ArcGIS](../../arcgis/README.md) users sharing content and helping each other on many channels, locations, ... Many Esri employees also participate on these communities in their spare time sharing contents, helping other users but also asking questions.

Here you will find a compilation of channels and contents.
