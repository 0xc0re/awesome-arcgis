You´ll find guided tutorials about our tools. etc. Know more about the developer plans. About ArcGIS ArcGIS is a 360º software platform built by Esri and it already have more than 100 software tools. Many of those tools are end-user software like desktop applications or mobile Applications but there are also many tools for developers and devops as you will see in this awesome list of resources. Learn more about the ArcGIS platform and it's creator Esri. ArcGIS community Most of ArcGIS traditional users are in geonet.esri.com. There you will find several places where you will find more people and help grouped by technologies, countries, etc. But you can also find developers with knowledge on ArcGIS at: Stackoverflow.com Github.com Meetup.com Linkedin.com Youtube.com In Spanish: ArcGIS developers: GeoDev Spain at Geonet esri-es.slack.com GIS developers: GeoDevelopers.org geodev.slack.com Some interesting twitter accounts you may want to follow: @EsriDevSummit, @EsriGeoDev,@EsriTraining, @EsriStartups, @EsriMooc, @EsriUKGeoDev, @ArcPy, @EsriPDX and some others Esri Accounts.

"},"about/":{"url":"about/","title":"About","keywords":"","body":" Note: this project is targeting developers but we also think ArcGIS users can benefit from it. About Context In this page I will try to explain to you why we started this project and the objective that it pursues. Sometimes we hear that people new to ArcGIS find difficult to understand the technology because there are too much information about Esri and ArcGIS, but also because it is spread in many websites. Some people also told us the documentation is tough to read because sometimes it assumes you already have some background on GIS and/or ArcGIS (and that's not always true). But even if you are already familiar with ArcGIS you might also suffer sometimes trying to find some documentation, resources, ... related to a product or technology, and that's because in Esri we have more than 150 different sites on different subdomains (with a few thousands of pages). Not even the search engines available1 . can offer a fulfilling solution to this problem, because not everything is ready to be indexed (for example some: community content or international distributor resources), and even if they could, they probably would not be able to properly structure and curate their results. About the project That's why we decided to build this project, a collection of awesome lists for ArcGIS developers, a place where anyone could find one page per technology or topic with the best official but also the best community resources we know, included the localized ones. Example awesome pages: Web AppBuilder Developer Edition, Configurable Apps, Web Map Spec, Esri-Leaflet, ArcGIS Pro and it's SDK, Runtime SDK for Android, REST APIs, etc, We are working closely with many ArcGIS experts to collect the best information available for each topic, but of course we would love you could contribute. Our goals are to make it easier for anyone: To get started developing with ArcGIS To have a better picture of the state of the art on any topic (with all its available resources) To stay updated To extend his knowledge about the ArcGIS platform and it possibilities. We really hope this project helps you to become an ArcGIS experts in the ArcGIS Platform.

Table of contents Introduction Types Contributions Introduction In addition to geodatabases, a fundamental goal of ArcGIS is to work with numerous file-based data types; DBMS data—including spatial types in the DBMS; and GIS web services from Google, Bing, ArcIMS, and ArcGIS for Server and others such as OGC web services. This topic provides an overview about many of the foreign spatial data formats supported by ArcGIS. ArcGIS lets you work with a number of data formats from many sources. Some of the supported data sources are listed here. Types Check the list of data formats supported in ArcGIS and if you need more you can also use the ArcGIS Data Interoperability extension for Desktop.

Work offline Table of contents Developer technologies Native apps Web apps Patterns Services pattern Desktop pattern Conflicts Contributions Each day we realize that been able to work offline with our mobile, tablet or desktop devices is more important, that why we offer you the chance to build applications that could work with maps & GIS without internet connection. There are many options to solve problems when you need apps to work offline, here you will find many of those. Developer technologies Native apps If you are a mobile developer or a desktop developer you have all our native Runtimes and SDKs and some builders to build you own custom apps. In case you are not a developer or you want to build an app quickly you also have AppStudio Standard and Survey123 that will help you build offline apps. And in case you don't need to but to build a custom or branded app you may also consider to use Collector for ArcGIS. Web apps But if you are a web developer and you don't need a powerful GIS SDK to build app you can also build it using phonegap. We also encourage you to take a look to the offline-editor-js project which is an ArcGIS JavaScript library for handling offline editing and tiling. If you are looking for a responsive app to collect points oflline you could take a look to GeoForm, a web app which can make the job (but it offline functionality is limited). If you don't know already, you should learn about progressive web apps in order to be learn how to build reliable, fast and engaging apps even when you have no Internet connection. Google is doing a great job spreading the word about it benefits. Check the videos at the Proggressive Web App Summit 2016 Prepare content to be consumed offline When you are developing an offline app you can follow two main patterns: Services pattern: Best for supporting a large number of users, this pattern allows multiple offline users to edit the same data layers and sync edits later, when online. Desktop pattern: Best for supporting applications with read-only data that requires periodic updates. Take maps offline with ArcGIS Online Patterns Services pattern The services pattern is best for supporting a large number of users. This pattern allows multiple offline users to edit the same data layers and sync edits later, when online. For operational data, you can use a sync-enabled feature service from ArcGIS for Server, ArcGIS Online, or Portal for ArcGIS to generate the geodatabase for offline use. Through the synchronization process, you can control whether a user can upload their changes, download others' changes, or both. This allows the application to have an up-to-date view of the data. When more than one user is editing the same feature and the edits conflict, the last edit synchronized to the service overrides the others. In one workflow, sometimes referred to as a pre-planned workflow, you generate the geodatabase once and load it onto your users' devices. This workflow requires you to register a geodatabase. For basemap data, ArcGIS tiled map services and ArcGIS Online basemaps allow for the on-demand creation of tile caches, letting you take your basemaps offline. Create a basemap from a tiled service (download a basemap): An offline copy of tiled map services can be requested so that a basemap is available when the application is working in an offline environment. These copies can be downloaded in the form of a tile package (.tpk file) or compact cache by using the API. Desktop pattern This is the best for supporting applications with read-only data that requires periodic updates. You can use ArcGIS for Desktop to include features, tabular data, tile caches, network datasets for directions and locators in your offline app. Learn more: Create ArcGIS Runtime content using ArcGIS Desktop To include operational data in your offline app generate a geodatabase (using ArcGIS for Desktop). Create a basemap using ArcGIS for Desktop: When you create a basemap using ArcGIS for Desktop, you can set the format, tiling schemes, and levels of detail. For details, see the online ArcGIS help topics How to create a tile package and About tile packages.
