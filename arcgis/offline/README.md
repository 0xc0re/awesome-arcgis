# Work offline

Each day we realize that been able to work offline with our mobile, tablet or
desktop devices is more important, that why we offer you the chance to build
applications that could work with maps & GIS without internet connection.

## Native apps
If you are a mobile or desktop developers you have all our native Runtimes and
SDKs and some builders to build you own custom apps.



## Web apps
But if you are a web developer and you don't need a powerful GIS SDK to build
app you can also build it using [phonegap](../front-end/phonegap).

We also encourage you to take a look to the [offline-editor-js project](../front-end/dojo/offline-editor-js) which is an ArcGIS JavaScript 
library for handling offline editing and tiling.

If you don't know already, you should learn about [progressive web apps](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) in order to be
learn how to build realiable, fast and enganging apps even when you have no
Internet connection.

Google is doing a great job spreading the word about it benefits.
