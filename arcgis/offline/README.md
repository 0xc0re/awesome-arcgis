# Work offline

Each day we realize that been able to work offline with our mobile, tablet or
desktop devices is more important, that why we offer you the chance to build
applications that could work with maps & GIS without internet connection.

There are many options to solve problems when you need apps to work offline, here
you will find many of those.

## Native apps
If you are a [mobile developer](../../mobile) or a [desktop developer](../../mobile)
you have all our native Runtimes and SDKs and some builders to build you own
custom apps.

In case you are not a developer or you want to build an app quickly you also
have [AppStudio Standard](../products/appstudio) and [Survey123](../products/survey123)
that will help you build offline apps.

And in case you don't need to but to build a custom or branded app you may also
consider to use [Collector for ArcGIS](http://www.esri.com/products/collector-for-arcgis).

## Web apps
But if you are a web developer and you don't need a powerful GIS SDK to build
app you can also build it using [phonegap](../../front-end/phonegap).

We also encourage you to take a look to the [offline-editor-js project](../../front-end/dojo/offline-editor-js) which is an ArcGIS JavaScript
library for handling offline editing and tiling.

If you are looking for a responsive app to collect points oflline you could take
a look to [GeoForm](https://github.com/Esri/geoform-template-js), a web app which can make the job (but it offline functionality 
  [is limited](https://geonet.esri.com/groups/survey123/blog/2015/09/04/survey123-collector-and-geoform-a-quick-comparison)).

If you don't know already, you should learn about [progressive web apps](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) in order to be
learn how to build reliable, fast and engaging apps even when you have no
Internet connection.

Google is doing a great job spreading the word about it benefits.
