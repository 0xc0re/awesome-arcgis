# OAuth

ArcGIS implements [OAuth 2.0](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/core-concepts/security-and-authentication/what-is-oauth-2/) to enable any developer to connect to [ArcGIS name users](../README.md) so an application can do anything a user is able to do in ArcGIS. E.g: view private content, manage content, run analysis, create users, can an organization settings, etc.
