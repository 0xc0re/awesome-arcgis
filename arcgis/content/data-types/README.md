# Data types

Most of the topics in this help section document how to use the [geodatabase](../data-storage/geodatabase/README.md) and a few other primary data formats that are native to ArcGIS.

## Introduction

In addition to [geodatabases](../data-storage/odatabase/README.md), a fundamental goal of ArcGIS is to work with numerous file-based data types; DBMS dataâ€”including spatial types in the DBMS; and GIS web services from Google, Bing, ArcIMS, and [ArcGIS for Server](../../products/arcgis-enterprise/arcgis-server/README.md) and others such as OGC web services. This page will help you to start digging on the spatial data formats supported by ArcGIS.

You will learn ArcGIS lets you work with a number of data formats from many different sources, here you will find some of those the supported data sources.

## Data types

Check the [list of data formats supported in ArcGIS](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/manage-data/datatypes/about-geographic-data-formats.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_4835793C55C0439593A46FD5BC9E64B9) and if you need more you can also use the [ArcGIS Data Interoperability extension for Desktop](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/manage-data/datatypes/about-geographic-data-formats.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_17EE0659B23345B9A655752949E49E3E).
