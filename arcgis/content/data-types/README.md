## Introduction
In addition to geodatabases, a fundamental goal of ArcGIS is to work with numerous file-based data types; DBMS dataâ€”including spatial types in the DBMS; and GIS web services from Google, Bing, ArcIMS, and ArcGIS for Server and others such as OGC web services. This topic provides an overview about many of the foreign spatial data formats supported by ArcGIS.

ArcGIS lets you work with a number of data formats from many sources. Some of the supported data sources are listed here.

## Data types (and formats)

Check the [list of data formats supported in ArcGIS](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/manage-data/datatypes/about-geographic-data-formats.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_4835793C55C0439593A46FD5BC9E64B9) and if you need more you can also use the [ArcGIS Data Interoperability extension for Desktop](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/manage-data/datatypes/about-geographic-data-formats.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_17EE0659B23345B9A655752949E49E3E).
