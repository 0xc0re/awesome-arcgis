# Multidimensional raster type

Multidimensional data formats are often used in the scientific community to store meteorological and oceanographic data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and direction.

## Introduction

Data is normally stored as variables, where each variable is a multidimensional array that represents data captured at multiple times, and at multiple heights or pressures

## Data Storage

* [NetCDF](../../../data-storage/file-formats/nc/README.md): support Climate and Forecast(CF) and Cooperative Ocean/Atmosphere Research Data Service (COARDS) conventions.
* GRIB
* HDF
