## Introduction


There are three main types of [imagery data](../../../esri/business-trends/data-management/imagery-data/README.md): [multispectral](../../../esri/business-trends/data-management/imagery-data/multispectral-image/README.md), [temporal](../../../esri/business-trends/data-management/imagery-data/temporal/README.md) and [elevation](../../../esri/business-trends/data-management/imagery-data/elevation/README.md).

There are many

Satellite web viewers:

* [Satellite or Junk?](https://esri.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=7b381ba8a99b4956be84136ccb087f1e): displays all known man-made satellites, approximately 14,000 in all

## Data storage

* **Database formats**: [DWG/DXF/DGN](../../data-storage/file-formats/dwg-dxf-dgn/README.md): are the file formats for CAD data (Computer-Aided Design aids in the creation, modification, analysis, or optimization of a 2D and 3D designs)
