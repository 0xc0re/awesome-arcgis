# GDB

A file GeoDataBase (GDB) is a collection of files in a folder on disk that can store, query, and manage both spatial (vector and raster) and nonspatial data.

## Introduction

> It is the evolution from the [personal geodatabase](../mdb/README.md) and it was introduced in ArcMap 9.2 (2006). It is also preferred over the [shapefile](../shapefile/README.md).

**Description**: A collection of various types of GIS datasets held in a file system folder.(This is the recommended native data format for ArcGIS stored and managed in a file system folder.)

**Number of users**: Single user and small workgroups:many readers or one writer per feature dataset, stand-alone feature class, or table. Concurrent use of any specific file eventually degrades for large numbers of readers.

**Storage format**: Each dataset is a separate file on disk. A file geodatabase is a file folder that holds its dataset files.

**Size limits**: One TB for each dataset. Each file geodatabase can hold many datasets. The 1 TB limit can be raised to 256 TB for extremely large image datasets. Each feature class can scale up to hundreds of millions of vector features per dataset.

**Versioning support**: Only supported as a geodatabase for clients who post updates using checkout and check-in and as a client to which updates can be sent using one-way replication.

**Platforms**: Cross-platform.

**Security and permissions**: Operating file system security.

**Database administration tools**: File system management.

**Notes**: You can optionally store data in a read-only compressed format to reduce storage requirements.

* [Comparing the three types of geodatabases](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/geodatabases/types-of-geodatabases.htm)
* [License a file geodatabase](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/administer-file-gdbs/license-file-geodatabase.htm): You can share data in a file geodatabase with other people and apply a license that determines the length of time they can use the data or whether they can export feature classes.
