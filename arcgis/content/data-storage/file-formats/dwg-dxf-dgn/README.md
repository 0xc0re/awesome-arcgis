## Introduction

Computer-Aided Design aids in the creation, modification, analysis, or optimization of a 2D and 3D designs. It is extensively used in many applications, including automotive, shipbuilding, and aerospace industries, industrial and architectural design, prosthetics, and many more

Currently, [AutoCAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoCAD) and [MicroStation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroStation) are the two most widely used general-purpose CAD platforms.

File formats for CAD data:

* **[DWG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.dwg)** is binary file format used for storing two- and three- dimensional design data and metadata (developer by [Autodesk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk) for AutoCAD)
* **[DXF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoCAD_DXF)** (Drawing eXchange File): To facilitate the reading of this type of files by other programs an exchange file was used: the
* **[DGN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DGN)** (Design): is the name used for CAD file formats compatible with Bentley Systems MicroStation.

The usual workflow when working with CAD data is to define a spatial reference, add the data to the map, georeference the dataset with existing data and set the display properties.
