# GPX

GPX (the GPS Exchange Format) is a light-weight XML data format for the interchange of GPS data (waypoints, routes, and tracks) between applications and Web services on the Internet.

## Introduction

[From Topografix](http://www.topografix.com/gpx_for_developers.asp):

> GPX was designed from the ground up to be the standard XML format for exchanging GPS data between applications. Because GPX is based on XML, it inherits all of the benefits of XML. XML is an open standard, with a rapidly growing base of developers and tool providers. GPX defines a common set of data tags for describing GPS and geographic data in XML. GPX is simple enough to learn in an hour, yet powerful enough to describe complex geographic objects. In addition to the standardized, public definition, GPX allows developers to define their own private objects and attributes. The GPX standard is designed to grow over time, and developers are encouraged to participate in the GPX Developers Forum, where new extensions to the GPX standard are reviewed.

### Tools

* [Features to GPX](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=067d6ab392b24497b8466eb8447ea7eb): This tool turns features into a GPX file (a file type used by GPS devices and Smart Phones with GPS applications).
