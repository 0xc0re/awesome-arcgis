# DXF file formats

**[DXF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoCAD_DXF)** (Drawing eXchange File)  is an interchange format originally developed in 1982 by Autodesk for enabling interoperability with other software applications.

## Introduction

> Computer-Aided Design aids in the creation, modification, analysis, or optimization of a 2D and 3D designs. It is extensively used in many applications, including automotive, shipbuilding, and aerospace industries, industrial and architectural design, prosthetics, and many more.

Currently, [AutoCAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoCAD) and [MicroStation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroStation) are the two most widely used general-purpose CAD platforms.

DXF usefulness is declining as software applications increasingly support the DWG format directly with licensed read/write technology from Autodesk or from third-party providers such as the [Open Design Alliance](http://www.opendesign.com/).

The usual workflow when working with CAD data is to define a spatial reference, add the data to the map, georeference the dataset with existing data and set the display properties.
