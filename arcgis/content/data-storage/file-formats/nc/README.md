## Quick overview

NetCDFâ€”NetCDF (Network Common Data Form) is a file format for storing multidimensional data. Refer to [Fundamentals of netCDF data storage for more information](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/manage-data/netcdf/fundamentals-of-netcdf-data-storage.htm).

NetCDF files created using other conventions may work, but are not supported. For a sample workflow, see Creating and visualizing a netCDF mosaic dataset.
