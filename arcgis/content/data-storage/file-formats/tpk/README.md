# Tile Package (TPK)

Tile packages (.tpk) are a set of tiles (images) from a map or raster dataset that can be published as a web tile or a web elevation layer. Alternatively, the tile package can be used as a basemap in ArcGIS applications.

## Introduction

The tiles are wrapped into a single file, a .tpk file, so you can share the file as you would any other. You can email it, copy it to a network locale, upload it to ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Enterprise, and so on.

The tiles, known as a tile cache, are static; updates to the input data are not reflected in the tile cache.
