## Introduction

GML (Geography Markup Language) is the XML standard of the OGC to represent information of spatial elements. The metadata exchange format is XML (eXtensible Markup Language).

GML was designed based on the abstract specification produced by the OpenGIS group, now Open Geospatial Consortium, and the ISO 19100 document series. GML does not contain specific information on how the visualization of the represented data should be done. For this, styles that are related to GML are used and are described in other XML sublanguages. Other extensions managed by GML include SMIL to define interaction elements and XPointer to represent metadata.

This format is used for the exchange of cadastral data, in addition to the Land Registry in Spain.
There are two formats, both based on the European INSPIRE directive:
* CP (Cadastral Parcel) for cadastral parcels
* BU (Building) for buildings.

One of the main problems of this trademark language is that there is the impossibility of downloading a GML document from a web service (server) other than that the web application was downloaded. This problem is called Cross-Domain.
