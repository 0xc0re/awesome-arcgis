## Introduction

Image layers have to be created in [ArcGIS Pro](../../../../products/arcgis-desktop/arcgis-pro/README.md) or [ArcMap](../../../../products/arcgis-desktop/arcmap-arccatalog/README.md) and published to [ArcGIS Online](../../../../products/arcgis-online/README.md) or [ArcGIS Enterprise](../../../../products/arcgis-enterprise/README.md).

## Image services in ArcGIS Online

Image services can published to ArcGIS Online but with some limitations

## Image services in ArcGIS Enterprise

If you licensed ArcGIS Server as an ArcGIS Image Server, these are the services you can publish and the GIS resource required:

* Raster dataset or mosaic dataset
* Layer file referencing a raster dataset or mosaic dataset
