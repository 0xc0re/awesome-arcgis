# Geodatabase
A geodatabase is a based on the relational database model and is allows you to store GIS information in one large file, which can contain multiple point, polygon, and/or polyline layers. It is a less “messy” way of organizing data than having multiple [shapefiles](../shapefile/README.md). in multiple folders.

## Introduction


Three types of geodatabases:

* [Personal geodatabases](./personal-geodatabase/README.md) (based on Microsoft Access)
* [File geodatabases](./personal-geodatabase/README.md) (Esri format based on multiple binary files)
* [Enterprise geodatabases](./personal-geodatabase/README.md) (work on top of Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc)

The functionality:
* Store datasets (tables for non spatial data, feature classes for vector data and raster), rules and relationships
* Reference rasters
* Behaviour rules and relationships to maintain integrity
* Addcional tools to help maintain the integrity of spatial data (advance data topology)
* Geometric networks (for route solving)
* Store toolboxes with geoprocessing tools, python scripts and models built in model builder
* Story address locators for geocoding tasks

Geodatabase can:
* store from a few MB until multiple terabytes of vector, raster and tabular data
* Support Multiple users and editor

## Get the tool

*If you need and [ArcGIS Developer Subscription](https://developers.arcgis.com/pricing/), if this technology depends on another one, if it is accesible though the Startup Program (or any other program), etc*

## Coding

### Code

* Compilation of sample code on: Github repositories, [codesharing.arcgis.com](http://codesharing.arcgis.com/) or any other known source.

### Tools

*Any additional tool that could help the developer to speedup*

## Awesome projects

*If it make sense, a list to nice apps build using this technology: live previews, videos from [Esri Events](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_yE3TatdZKAXvt_TzGJ6mw) (at plenaries for example), business cases, etc*

## Community

Where can a developer find the community talking about this technology? (GeoNet?, Stackoverflow?, Stackexchange?, Github?, ....)

### People you should know

Replace `TOPIC` in the next paragram and remove the \`\`\`.

```
Please find the ArcGIS Experts on this topic here: [https://esri-es.github.io/arcgis-experts/?topic=TOPIC](https://esri-es.github.io/arcgis-experts/?topic=TOPIC)

They don't work on the support team and some may even not work at Esri,
but they are opening some projects and sharing insights related to this
technology so we recommend you to follow them.
```

## News

* Links to articles to specific articles but also to any source of news. E.g: [blogs.esri.com](blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/tag/TOPIC/), [esri.com/search?filter=Blogs&q=TOPIC&search=Search](https://www.esri.com/search?filter=Blogs&q=geoanalytics&search=Search), [Blog Posts insite Places at GeoNet](https://community.esri.com/community/developers/web-developers/arcgis-api-for-javascript/content?filterID=contentstatus%5Bpublished%5D~objecttype~objecttype%5Bblogpost%5D), etc.


## Additional resources

Replace `TOPIC` in the next paragram and remove the \`\`\`.

```
Probably not all the resources are in this list, please use the [ArcGIS Search](https://esri-es.github.io/arcgis-search/) tool looking for: ["TOPIC"](https://esri-es.github.io/arcgis-search/?search="TOPIC"&utm_campaign=awesome-list&utm_source=awesome-list&utm_medium=page).
```

### Locatized resources

*In case a distributor has made additional documentation, docs, etc* (add a ```####Language``` section)

### Other related list of resources

*Other pages in the awesome list that could be helpful for the target audience of this page (or third party awesome lists)*
