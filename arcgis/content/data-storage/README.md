## Introduction

There are two main ways to store and manage any type of data in a computer, here you will learn about different ways to store geographic information:

* **[Using databases](./databases/README.md)**
* **[Using files](./file-formats/README.md)** (binary or plain text)

## ArcGIS storage

The benefits from storing content inside ArcGIS are:

* Been able to run spatial analysis inside the platform
* Consume your data from any [ArcGIS product](../../products/README.md)
* ...

> **Recommendation**: If you are building an app using ArcGIS we recommended you to store your content in an ArcGIS storage because that way you will get the most of the APIs and SDKs

## ArcGIS services

Long time ago both the applications an the source code use to live in the same machine. Nowadays software architectures have evolved and distributed software is very common.

That's why ArcGIS provide many service type to be able to access to all the content stored in your databases or files.

Learn more about [ArcGIS service types](./service-types/README.md) and how you can benefit from them. 

## Additional resources

Probably not all the resources are in this list, please use the [ArcGIS Search](https://esri-es.github.io/arcgis-search/) tool looking for: ["storage"](https://esri-es.github.io/arcgis-search/?search="storage"&utm_campaign=awesome-list&utm_source=awesome-list&utm_medium=page).
