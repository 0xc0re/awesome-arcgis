## Introduction

Create new service operations to extend the base functionality of map or image services. Most SOEs do this by using ArcObjects to work with GIS data and maps and provide the most flexibility in writing GIS functions.


## Training

Extending services: [Linux](http://server.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/publish-services/linux/about-extending-services.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_10A299337E3C4F3197F02F5C142B9BA8)
