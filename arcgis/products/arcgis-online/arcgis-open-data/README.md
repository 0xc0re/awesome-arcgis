## Introduction

[ArcGIS Open Data](http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcgisonline/arcgis-open-data) is an Esri hosted and managed solution that is included with ArcGIS Online. Set up a public-facing website within minutes to share your open data.

Open Data is an important part of the [Esri Open Vision](../../../../esri/open-vision/README.md) and together with [ArcGIS Hub](../../arcgis-hub/README.md) any organization can create initiatives to engage citizens to help solve real problems using authoritative Data.

You can also explore more than [86K Open Datasets](https://hub.arcgis.com/pages/open-data) released by more than 4770 organizations though the [ArcGIS Hub](https://hub.arcgis.com/pages/open-data).

## Code

Many componentes of the ArcGIS Open Data product are Open Source themselves, here you can find a few:

* [KoopJS](../../../../devops/technologies/koop/README.md): ETL engine that allows to export data in different format in ArcGIS Open Data.
* [Cedar](../../../../front-end/technologies/cedar/README.md): charting library used to explore the data
* [opendata-search-component](https://github.com/esridc/opendata-search-component): A custom element for adding ArcGIS Open Data search capability
