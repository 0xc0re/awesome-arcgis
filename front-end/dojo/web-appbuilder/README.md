# Web AppBuilder for ArcGIS (Developer Edition)
Web AppBuilder is:
* For non-developers: A WYSIWYG tool that allow them to build and export responsive web apps adding and configuring pre-defined widgets and themes.
* For developers: It is also a framework that can be extended adding custom
themes and widgets.
