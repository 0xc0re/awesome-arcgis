## Introduction
At this point in time there are two generations of the ArcGIS API been maintained:
* [3.x generation](3.x): for 2D maps
* [4.x generation](4.x): integrates 2D and 3D

If you are familiar with the ArcGIS API you can check this
[functionality matrix](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/guide/choose-version/index.html),
if you are not you can ask for help on the [JavaScript API group at GeoNet](https://geonet.esri.com/community/developers/web-developers/arcgis-api-for-javascript).
