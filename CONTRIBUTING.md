# Contributions

Please feel free to contribute to this list. The technology change fast and
some resources may be out to date.

You can use the "[resource page template](RESOURCE_PAGE_TEMPLATE.md)" to start a new resource page or to get ideas on which resources could be included.

A sample resources list that shows what we are trying to collect on each page is the
[Web AppBuilder resource page](arcgis/products/web-appbuilder/README.md).

##Â Ways to contribute

* If you find a broken link feel free to [open an issue](issue) or add a comment on Disqus
* If you find some missing information do the same thing
* You can help us just adding resources directly editing from your browser ([learn how](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/)).
* If you are a developer you can also fork this repo, do a pull request and optionally create a new deployment.

## Develop and build locally

First you need to have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed in your computer and they from the root folder run:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run install
```

To start the development environment run:

`$ npm run serve`

> Be patient, it will take some time but whenever it is ready you will see a message saying `Serving book on http://localhost:4000`

And whenever you are ready to create the new deployment run:

`$ npm run build`

> Be patient, this process can take a few minutes
