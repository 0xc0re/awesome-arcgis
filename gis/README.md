## Introduction

[From 'Geographic information system' at Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system):

> In general, the term describes any information system that integrates, stores, edits, analyzes, shares, and displays geographic information. GIS applications are tools that allow users to create interactive queries (user-created searches), analyze spatial information, edit data in maps, and present the results of all these operations.
